# autometal-piwik

## DESCRIPTION:
A simple Ruby client for the Piwik API. This gem is based on Rodrigo Tassinari de Oliveira's piwik gem (https://github.com/riopro/piwik). Since it hasn't been updated since 2008, I took the liberty to fork it, and finish it up.

## FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

  * Object-oriented interface to the Piwik API;
  * For now, only a small subset of the API is implemented (only basic actions)

## SYNOPSIS:
Piwik is an open source web analytics software, written in PHP. It provides an 
extensive REST-like API, and this gem aims to be a simple Ruby wrapper to access 
this API in a Ruby-friendly way. For example:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'piwik'
    Piwik.auth_token = "i need to configure simple-piwik with my auth_token here"
    Piwik.piwik_url = "http://piwik.mypiwikdomain.org"
    site = Piwik::Site.load(1)
    => #<Piwik::Site:0xb74bf994 @name="Example.com", @config={:auth_token=>"some_auth_key", :piwik_url=>"http://your.piwi.install"}, @id=1, @main_url="http://www.example.com", @created_at=Tue Jul 15 18:55:40 -0300 2008>
    site.pageviews(:month, Date.today)
    => 3002378
    user = Piwik::User.load(1, 'http://piwik.mypiwikdomain.org', 'my_auth_key')
    => #<Piwik::User:0xb66bf544 @login="Example.com", @config={:auth_token=>"some_auth_key", :piwik_url=>"http://your.piwi.install"}, @id=1, @main_url="http://www.example.com", @created_at=Tue Jul 15 18:55:40 -0300 2008>

Configuring with initializer config/initializers/simple-piwik.rb :
  
    if Rails.env.production? 
      Piwik.piwik_url  # "http://piwik.mypiwikdomain.org"
      Piwik.auth_token # "2ad590308b1efa590a9a43ad86d3ac1s"
    elsif Rails.env.development?
      #this is currently set to the same as production
      Piwik.piwik_url  # "http://piwik.mypiwikdomain.org"
      Piwik.auth_token # "2ad590308b1efa590a9a43ad86d3ac1s"
    end

  * Piwik website (http://piwik.org)
  * Piwik API reference (http://dev.piwik.org/trac/wiki/API/Reference)

## REQUIREMENTS:

    activesupport, rest-client, json

## INSTALL:

## CHANGELOG:
  * 0.6.0 
  Merged a few update from [Mihael's fork](https://github.com/Achillefs/autometal-piwik/pull/5)
  * 0.4.2
  Final fix for inconsistent API outputs caused by Rails using its own version of XmlSimple.
  * 0.4.1
  Quick fixed api result parsing in site creation. The API's responses are inconsistent, but I am not sure why.
  * 0.4.0
  Added Piwik::Trackable controller mixing, pretty much swiped off of halfdan's piwik analytics project (https://github.com/halfdan/piwik_analytics/). The version included in this plugin is not suitable for application tracking, and is instead geared towards tracking multiple websites stored as ActiveRecord models
  * 0.3.0
  UsersManager CRUD implementation, with tests
  * 0.2.3
  Started adding some tests
  * 0.2.0
  Reworked plugin to also look for a rails config file called piwik.yml, and not just the .piwik user prefs file.
  * 0.0.2 2008-07-22 (riopro)
  * Added specs for existing API methods
  * Created RubyForge project at http://rubyforge.org/projects/piwik/
  * 0.0.1 2008-07-21 (riopro)
  * major enhancement:
  * Initial release
